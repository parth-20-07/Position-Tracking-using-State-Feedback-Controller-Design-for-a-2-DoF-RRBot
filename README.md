# About

The assignment aims to derive the equations of motion for a 2-DoF Revolute Revolute Arm.

![RRBot](./Docs/Images/RRBot.png)

I worked on deriving the equation of motion by taking the derivatives of the Lagrangian Function. This method is called as Euler-Lagrange Method.

The Lagrange Equation uses the terms Kinetic and Potential Energy of the system. Where,f

$$
LE = KE - PE
$$

The Euler-Lagrangian Equations can be derived by taking a derivative of the Lagrangian Equations. Where,

$$
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q_{i}}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial{q_{i}}}= u_{i}\notag
\end{equation}
$$

This would result in an equation of form $a\ddot{q} + b\dot{q} + c{q} + d = 0$. We solve for $\ddot{q_{i}}$ which results in the equation of motion for the system. This system does not contain any form of input. Thus, $u_{i} = 0$ for all joints.

## MATLAB
The complete calculation has been done [here (webpage form)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/parth-20-07/2-DoF-Revolute-Revolute-robot-arm-Equation-of-Motion/blob/21aea4f0ee493422593e973d1964ae5801dc50d7/Solution/MATLAB/main.html) in MATLAB. The systems with the equation of motion are simulated as follows

## Gazebo and ROS

The same system is simulated with the equations of motion present in Gazebo with real-world physics replication as shown [here (webpage form)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/parth-20-07/2-DoF-Revolute-Revolute-robot-arm-Equation-of-Motion/blob/main/Solution/Gazebo/rrbot_passive.html). It generates in system behaving as follows

**Possible Reasons for difference:**
- The lack of friction in the MATLAB System.
- The estimated value of gravitational acceleration in MATLAB.
